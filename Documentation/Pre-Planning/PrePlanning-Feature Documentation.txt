2. Snowball Spawning
3. Player Movement
4. Camera Movement
5. Random Prop Placer
6. Mountain Generation
7. Game Flow
8. Player Stats
## Snowball Behaviour
- Continuously move downwards.
- Grow in size will moving and in contact with ground.
- Split into two half-sized snowballs upon collision with a prop or player.
- Rotate when moving.
## Snowball Spawning
- Object pooling for spawning.
- Decide on spawning mechanism.
- Create snowball GO prefab.
### Mechanism Options
A. Spawn from the sky.
	- Easier to implement. (A)
	- Makes logical sense for players. (A)
	- Player can get killed without warning if under recently spawned falling snowball. (D)
	- Removes the needed modelling of a "source". (A)
	- The higher up the player is, the easier it will be. (D/A)
B. Spawn from a "source" that is positioned on the mountain.
	- More difficult to implement. (D) 
	- Provides a spawner package as a by-product. (A)
	- Makes less logical sense for players. (D)
	- Player will not get unexpectedly killed from falling snowballs. (A)
	- Allows creative source concept. (A)
	- Does not require a "source" concept and could instead spawn at a really small size. (A)
## Player Movement
- Research for desired implementation of player movement.
- Ability to move in basic directions.
- Abiliy to sprint for a fixed duration.
- Ability to jump.
- Player GO prefab.
### Notes
- Only implementing keyboard & mouse for prototype.
## Camera Movement
- Research 3rd person camera movement implementations.
- Implement basic mouse camera movement.
### Notes
- Utilize cinemachine implementation.
## Random Prop Placer
- Implement procedural prop placement using Perlin noise.
- Create placeholder prefab for placeable prop.
- Refactor current implementation.
- Enable a cutoff height for props to be placed.
- Create custom editor for implementation.
### Notes
- Already mostly completed for Prototype milestone.
## Mountain Generation
- Enable the bunching of middle points to provide a more peaked mountain.
- Move the bunched middle points to the opposite side that the player will spawn on to ensure that the player can climb the slopes.
- Improve the noise generation to create more "jagged/rocky" slope changes.
- Implement some procedural cave generation to encourage exploration.
### Notes
- Already complete for Prototype milestone.
- Improvements can be done in Post-Prototype milestone.
## Game Flow
- Create beginning GUI for the player to see when they start the game.
- Create the beginning scene for the player to see when they start the game.
- Create a scene transition from the beginning scene to the gameplay.
- Create a "goal" area that will spawn at/near the summit of the game.
- Create a win GUI for when the player reaches the "goal" area.
- Create a gameover GUI for when the player dies.
- Create the GUI for the player stats.
- Enable the player to play another game if they choose after winning.
- Create a spawn point where the player will always start at.
- Create a transition animation between scenes.
## Player Stats
- Implement player health.
- Have collisions with "large" snowballs decrease health.
- Have the game over trigger once the player's health reaches zero.
- Implement player stamina.
- Have the stamina go down as the player sprints.
- Have the player not be able to sprint when the stamina reaches zero.
- Have the stamina slowly increase over time when the player is not sprinting.
- Have the player move slower when they completely run out of stamina until it is fully regenerated.
