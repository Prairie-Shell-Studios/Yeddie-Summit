## Using Transform

1. You can set the transform.position of an object to a specific Vector3.
	- Moves the object relatively to the world position.
2. You can increment the transform.position of an object be a Vector3.
	- Moves the object relatively to the world position.
3. You can use the Translate method.
	- Moves the object relatively to its position.
	
Continuous movement can be done by calling these from the Update or FixedUpdate function.
When doing this, make sure to multiply the amount by Time.deltaTime because every frame does not take the same amount of time.
